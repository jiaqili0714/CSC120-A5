- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was really confused at first of how association actually works in code, though the concept is not hard to understand.

Writing out the code for accessors and constructors for Engine, Car, Passenger is not hard, assembling them is the most difficult ones. When creating the new object train, I didn't know how to use the new parameters. I recommend looking for association examples online first, get an idea of how do people usually use association, then start assembling them.
